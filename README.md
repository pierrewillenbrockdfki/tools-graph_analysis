# Graph Analysis
[![Build Status](https://github.com/rock-core/tools-graph_analysis/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/rock-core/tools-graph_analysis/actions/workflows/test.yml)


This library provides functionality for analyzing graphs and networks.
Its core functionality will come from other graph libraries such as [boost
graph](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html),
[SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/snap/),
[LEMON](http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon).
Further graph libraries are available, but have not been integrated
[igraph](http://igraph.sourceforge.net), [graph-tool](http://graph-tool.skewed.de/),
[ogdf](http://ogdf.net/doku.php).

## Motivation
A number of different graph libraries exists - as listed above - though they cannot always be compared in a one to one fashion.
This library tries to provide a standard interface while maintaining access to
the particular features of each library.
The initial intention of implementing this graph library front-end was to benefit
from complementary graph algorithm implementations and add complementary
functionality.
Here, multi-commodity min-cost flow optimisation algorithms as well as, graph
filtering and percolation.
The goal of this library is to maintain a consistent and capable high-level
interface abstraction to facilitate graph modelling and analysis.

In addition, the graph analysis library comes with a small framework to design
graph-based UI in QT (see below).

## Examples

### Standard API Usage

```
#include "GraphAnalysis.hpp"
#include "lemon/Graph.hpp"
...
using namespace graph_analysis;

class MyVertex : Vertex
{
public:
    MyVertex(const std::string& attr)
        : mAttribute(attr)
    {}

    std::string getClassName() const { return "MyVertex"; }
    std::string toString() const { return getClassName() + " " + mAttribute; }
protected:
    /// To allow for cloning of graphs using deep copy
    Vertex* getClone() const { return new MyVertex(*this); }
private:
    std::string mAttribute;
};

BaseGraph::Ptr graph = BaseGraph::getInstance(BaseGraph::LEMON_DIRECTED_GRAPH);
Vertex::Ptr v0 = make_shared<MyVertex>();
Vertex::Ptr v1 = make_shared<MyVertex>();

Edge::Ptr e0 = make_shared<Edge>();
e0->setSourceVertex(v0);
e0->setTargetVertex(v1);

graph->add(e0);

int vertexCount = graph->getVertexCount();
int vertexCountInternal = ::lemon::countNodes(graph.raw());

VertexIterator::Ptr vertexIt = graph->getVertexIterator();
while(vertexIt->next())
{
   Vertex::Ptr vertex = vertexIt->current();
   printf("Vertex: %s\n", vertex->toString().c_str());
}

EdgeIterator::Ptr edgeIt = graph->getEdgeIterator();
while(edgeIt->next())
{
   Edge::Ptr edge = edgeIt->current();
   printf("Edge: %s\n", edge->toString().c_str());
}
```

### Graph I/O

Please refer to the detailed description of graph_analysis::io::GraphIO which is part of the doxygen
documentation.

### Graph GUI

This library provides a UI that permits developing other Qt-based interfaces that are based on graphs.
This UI intends to provide a mini-framework and basis for other projects to build on, by
reusing the GraphWidget class.

The UI supports:

 - import/export from/to gexf
 - save as pdf or svg
 - layouting of the graph using graphviz layout engine

After installation you can start the UI by calling:

```
    graph_analysis-gui
```

## Installation from GitHub

Create a new Rock-based installation in a development folder, here called dev:
```
    mkdir dev
    cd dev
    wget http://www.rock-robotics.org/master/autoproj_bootstrap
    ruby autoproj_bootstrap
```

In autoproj/manifest add the respective manifest and add the package to the
layout section:
```
    package_set:
        - github: rock-core/rock-package_set

    layout:
        - tools/graph_analysis
```

```
$>source env.sh
$>autoproj update
$>autoproj osdeps
$>amake tools/graph_analysis
```

## Generate the documentation

To see the documentation of this project please do the following after
checkout to generate the doxygen-base documentation:

```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    make doc
```

Open the doxygen documentation with a browser: build/doc/index.html
The doxygen documentation contains all information on how to start
using the library along with the general API documentation.

## Testing

Running test in Rock is control via the Flag ROCK_TEST_ENABLED.
So activate the tests let autoproj set this cmake build flag:
```
$> autoproj test enable tools/graph_analysis
$> amake tools/graph_analysis
```

Then you can run the tests, which are implemented with Boost Testing Framework with:
```
$> ./build/test/test_graph --log_level=all
```
